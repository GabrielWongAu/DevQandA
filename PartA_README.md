# T4A2 - Full Stack Application - Part A Documentation
### **Requirement R1: Description of your website**

**Purpose**

The purpose of the Dev Q&A website is to provide an open-source question and answer forum, where developers (e.g. aspiring developers, CS students, bootcamp students, self-learners, professional developers) can post their questions and other developers can provide helpful answers. The website is targeted at **questioners** (developers posting questions) and **respondents** (developers posting answers to questions). It is open to the public to read however you will need to sign up for an account in order to post a question, post an answer or upvote or downvote questions/answers.

**What is important for Questioners?**

Figuring things out as a developer can sometimes feel very lonely. Especially if you are new to the industry and don’t have any friends who are developers. As someone just starting out in programming, you might get stuck on a coding problem and not know where to turn to. This is the problem Dev Q&A is trying to solve.

Alternatively you may be a CS student or bootcamp student. You may be learning programming concepts formally but still have knowledge gaps that require filling. As a developer student, you want to be able to ask questions in a safe and welcoming place. Dev Q&A provides this online space for students to ask their questions. 

**What is important for Respondents?**

As a CS student or bootcamp student, you may want to consolidate your knowledge. You may have been taught various CS concepts and theories which you understand. But you realise the best way to test your knowledge is whether you are able to teach the concepts to others. Dev Q&A allows you to solve this need of consolidating knowledge by answering other people’s questions. The forum also encourages the spirit of open source and giving back by having a leaderboard.

You may be a professional developer who is passionate about development. You may wish to give back to the community just like how others have helped you when you were starting out. Dev Q&A provides you with this avenue of helping others and giving back. 

As a respondent, you want to see how your answers are received. By users having the option to upvote and downvote answers, you will be able to see whether your questions/answers resonate with people. There will also be a leaderboard which provides a running tally of the people with the most upvoted answers.
